TABLE OF CONTENTSEmergency First Aid Guidelines for California Schools

The Emergency First Aid Guidelines for California Schools’ document was initially developed by San 
Diego and Alameda Counties, funded in part by a grant from the California Emergency Medical Services 
(EMS) Authority.  The Guidelines were originally based on the second edition of the Ohio Emergency 
Guidelines for Schools, 2000.  The Emergency First Aid Guidelines for California Schools manual is 
meant to provide recommended procedures for school staff in responding to medical emergencies when 
the school nurse is not available and until emergency medical services responders arrive on scene.  
These guidelines provide recommended actions and do not supersede or invalidate any laws or rules 
established by a school system, a school board, or the State.
Due to declining school district budgets, school nurses are not always present on school grounds when 
medical emergencies occur.  It is not uncommon to have a school nurse present for only two hours a 
week	per	campus.		Currently,	only	fifty	percent	(50%)	of	school	districts	in	California	have	a	school	nurse	
on staff.  The Emergency First Aid Guidelines for California Schools was developed over a two-year 
period and piloted in thirteen schools in San Diego County and three schools in Alameda County.  They 
were enthusiastically received in the pilot areas by school nurses and educators as a layperson’s 
emergency medical reference tool. 
 
Once the pilot projects were completed, the draft Guidelines were reviewed and revised by the local 
Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) Coordinators Group and the EMSC Technical Advisory 
Committee (TAC).  Extensive comments and revisions were made by these committees.  The EMSC 
Coordinators Group is composed of local EMSC program managers and the TAC membership is 
composed of emergency physicians, nurses, prehospital and administrative experts in EMSC.  The 
EMSC	TAC	first	approved	the	draft	Guidelines	during	its	January	29,	2004	meeting	and	forwarded	the	
document to the EMS Authority for review and approval. 
During	the	first	revision	of	the	Guidelines	document	in	2004,	the	EMS	Authority	collaborated	with	the	
California Department of Education and the California School Nurses Association.  The revised 
Emergency First Aid Guidelines for California Schools’ document was sent out for a 30-day public 
comment period from April 16, 2004 to May 17, 2004.  Comments and suggested revisions received 
have been incorporated into the Guidelines and/or responded to as appropriate.  The Emergency First 
Aid Guidelines for Schools document was approved on June 23, 2004 by the Commission on EMS.  
One hard copy and a CD of the Guidelines were distributed to approximately 10,000 California schools.
The current version, the second revision, is based on 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for 
CPR and ECC, which was approved by the EMSC TAC and EMSC Coordinators Group on January 
26-27, 2012.

ABOUT THE GUIDELINES (CONT.)
Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the format and review the “How to Use the Guidelines” 
section on page 6 prior to an emergency situation.  The guidelines are recommended procedures for 
when advanced medically trained personnel are not available on the school site.  It is strongly 
recommended that staff who are in a position to provide first aid to students complete an 
approved first-aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) course.  Please consult your school 
nurse if you have any questions concerning the recommendations contained in the guidelines.  
These guidelines should not delay calling 9-1-1 in the event of an emergency.    
Periodically, the EMS Authority may send out updates on procedures dealing with the medical 
emergencies that are in the guidelines.  When received, please remove the old information and replace 
with the updated information.
We welcome comments, suggestions, or experiences using these guidelines.

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
1. Remain calm and assess the situation.  Be sure the situation is safe for you to approach.  
 The following dangers will require caution: live electrical wires, gas leaks, chemical exposure, 
	 building	damage,	unstable	structures,	fire	or	smoke,	traffic,	agitated	or	violent	students.
2.  A responsible adult should stay at the scene and give help until the person designated to 
 handle emergencies arrives.  For serious injury or illness, call 9-1-1 without delay.
3.  Notify the responsible school nurse or administrator designated to handle emergencies. Upon   
 arrival this person should take charge of the emergency.
4. Do NOT give medications unless there has been prior written approval by the person’s 
 parent or legal guardian and doctor.  Administer medications according to local school board   
 policy and state or federal laws and regulations.
5. Do NOT move a severely injured or ill person unless absolutely necessary for immediate 
 safety.  If moving is necessary, protect the neck by keeping it straight to prevent further injury,   
 see the “Neck and Back Pain” guideline (pg. 56).
6. Call Emergency Medical Services (EMS 9-1-1), if appropriate, or arrange for transportation of   
 the ill or injured person, if necessary.  Provide EMS personnel with copies of physician/parents’  
 signed record of medical instructions for emergencies (i.e., pupil emergency card).
7.  The responsible school nurse, administrator, or a designated employee should notify the 
 parent/legal guardian of the emergency as soon as possible to determine the appropriate   
 course of action.
8.  If the parent/legal guardian cannot be reached, notify a parent/legal guardian substitute and   
 call either the physician or the hospital designated on the Emergency Information Card, so they  
 will know to expect the injured or ill person.
9.  Each person should have an emergency information record (i.e., student emergency card) 
	 on	file	that	provides	essential	contact	information,	medical	conditions,	medications	and	an		 	
 emergency care plan if appropriate. Provide a copy of student’s emergency information to EMS  
 upon arrival, if authorized by parent/legal guardian.
10.  Fill out a report for all injuries and illnesses requiring above procedures if indicated by 
 school policy.

DEVELOPING AN EMERGENCY PLAN
A school-wide emergency plan should be developed in cooperation with school health staff, school 
administrators, local EMS, local hospital, local health department and parent/guardian organizations.  All 
employees should be trained on the emergency plan and a written copy should be available at all times.  
The plan should be reviewed and updated annually, and should consider the following:
•	 Staff	roles	are	clearly	defined	in	writing.		For	example,	staff	responsibility	for	rendering	care,	
accessing EMS, notifying responsible school administrator and parents, and supervising uninjured 
children are outlined and practiced.  A responsible administrator for emergency situations has been 
designated within each school.  In-service training is provided to maintain knowledge and skills for 
employees designated to respond to emergencies.
•	 At least	one	individual,	other	than	the	nurse,	is	trained	in	CPR	and	first	aid	in	each	school.	Teachers	
and employees working in high-risk areas or activities (e.g., labs, gyms, shops, P.E., etc.) are trained in 
CPR,	use	of	AED,	and	first	aid.
•	 With	appropriate	staff	training,	these	First	Aid	Guidelines	could	be	utilized	by	staff	for	immediate	care	
of students. The Guidelines are to be distributed or available to appropriate employees.
•	 Files	are	in	order	for	each	student	and	are	kept	in	a	central	location.		The	files	should	contain	current	
emergency contact and authorization information, immunization and medical records, phone number of 
student’s doctor, medication administration forms and emergency care plans for students with special 
needs.
•	 First	aid	kits	are	stocked	with	up-to-date	supplies	and	are	available	in	central	locations,	high-risk	
areas, and for extracurricular activities.  See “ Recommended First Aid Supplies” (pg. 74)
•	 All	employees	have	rapid	access	to	emergency	numbers.		Emergency	numbers	are	available	and	
posted by phones.  See “Emergency Phone Numbers” (pg. 75) 
•	 School	personnel	have	communicated	with	local	EMS	regarding	the	emergency	plan,	services	
available, persons with special needs and other pertinent information about the school.
•	 A 	written	policy	describes	procedures	for	accessing	EMS	without	delay	from	all	locations	(e.g.,	
playgrounds,	athletic	fields,	fieldtrips,	extracurricular	activities,	etc.).	
•	 A	written	policy	that	provides	instructions	for	transportation	of	an	injured	or	ill	student.
•	 Considerations	and	procedures	for	a	person	with	special	needs.		See	“ Planning for Persons with 
Special Needs” (pg. 12)
•	 A	doctor	or	school	nurse	and	a	dentist	are	designated	to	act	as	consultants	to	the	school	for	health	
and safety related questions. (Education Code 44871-44878)
•	 All	injuries	are	documented	in	a	standard	format	and	maintained	in	an	organized	manner.		Injury	
reports are reviewed on a regular basis to revise the emergency plan and remedy hazards. Emergency First Aid Guidelines for California Schools
13
PLANNING FOR PERSONS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS
Some persons in your school may have special emergency care needs due to their 
medical conditions or functional needs.
Medical Conditions:
Some persons may have special or chronic conditions that put them at risk for serious or life-
threatening emergencies.  For example, persons who have:
•	 Seizures
•	 Life-threatening	or	severe	allergic	reactions
•	 Diabetes
•	 Technology-dependent	or	medically	fragile	conditions		
Your	school	nurse	or	other	duly	qualified	supervisor	of	health,	along	with	the	person’s	parent	or	legal	
guardian and personal physician, should develop individual emergency care plans for these persons 
when they are enrolled.  These emergency care plans should be made available to appropriate staff 
at all times.  In the event of an emergency situation, refer to the person’s emergency care plan.  The 
American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 
have created an Emergency Information Form for Children with Special Needs.  It can be 
downloaded from www.aap.org or www.acep.org.
Physical Abilities:
Other persons in your school may have special emergency needs due to physical disabilities. For 
example, persons who are:
•	 Deaf
•	 Blind
•	 In	wheel	chairs	or	using	other	assistive	devices
•	 Unable	or	have	difficulty	walking	up	or	down	stairs
•	 Temporarily	on	crutches
These	persons	will	need	special	arrangements	in	the	event	of	a	school-wide	emergency	(e.g.,	fire,	
tornado, earthquake, building collapse, evacuation, etc.).A plan should be developed and a responsible person should be designated to assist 
these persons and staff to safety.  All appropriate staff should be aware of this plan.Emergency First Aid Guidelines for California Schools

IN SCHOOL SETTINGS
A	significant	and	growing	number	of	school	children	have	health	problems	that	require	the	adminis-
tration of medication during the school day.  There are several reasons why students might require 
medications	in	schools,	including:	(1)	chronic	conditions	requiring	medication	in	order	to	benefit	
from classroom instruction; (2) acute, but temporary, medical needs that require medicine during 
the school day, such as an antibiotic for an infection; or (3) conditions that might require emergency 
medication, such as an Epinephrine (Epi-pen)® for a bee sting or food allergy.
 
Children	who	require	medications	in	order	to	fully	benefit	from	public	education	are	protected	by	
federal and state disability laws.  It has become a complex issue due to a variety of factors, such 
as federal and state disability law, new pharmaceutical and medical technologies, evolving mental 
and medical health practices, fewer full-time school nurses, and increasing numbers of children with 
complex as well as simple health needs in schools. 
The National Association of School Nurses states that the school nurse has the educational back -
ground,	knowledge,	and	licensure	that	provide	the	unique	qualifications	to	direct	the	administration	of	
medications in the school setting.  The position statement recommends that “school districts develop 
policies and procedures to address medication administration in accordance with federal and state 
laws and guidelines.” 1 			If	a	child	needs	specified	medication	during	the	course	of	the	school	day	
to	attend	school	and	benefit	from	the	educational	program;	it	is	in	the	school’s	interest	to	make	this	
accommodation.2 
California law states, 3 	with	a	few	clearly	specified	legal	exceptions,	that	only	a	licensed	nurse	or	
physician may administer medication.  In the school setting, these exceptions are situations where: 
(1) The student self-administers the medication;  (2) parent or parent designee, such as a relative or 
close friend, administers the medication4; or (3) there is a public disaster or epidemic.5 
The Legislature has enacted four statutes that authorize unlicensed school personnel to be trained 
and	supervised	in	order	to	administer	four	specific	medications	in	medical	emergencies:	
1. Under the supervision of a school nurse or physician designee, an unlicensed school 
 employee may administer epinephrine via auto-injector; 6
2. Under the supervision of a school nurse, physician, registered nurse, or public health 
 nurse, an unlicensed school employee may administer glucagon; 7
3. Under the supervision of a school nurse, physician, registered nurse, or public health 
 nurse, an unlicensed school employee may administer Diastat, and 8
4. Under the supervision of a school nurse, physician, registered nurse, or public health 
 nurse, an unlicensed school employee may administer insulin. 9   Emergency First Aid Guidelines for California Schools

MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION 
IN SCHOOL SETTINGS (CONT.)
In accordance with Education Code (EC) sections 49414, 49414.5 an unlicensed school employee 
could “administer” epinephrine via auto-injector directly into a student suffering anaphylaxis, 
glucagon via needle and syringe directly into a student suffering from severe hypoglycemia, 
insulin, via needle and syringe directly into a student suffering from severe hyperglycemia or Diastat, 
a medication that is administered rectally to a student with epilepsy suffering from seizures.   
No other California statute allows an unlicensed school employee to administer any other medication 
in California public schools, even if the unlicensed school employee is trained and supervised by a 
school nurse or other similarly licensed nurse. 
EC Section 49423 permits the school nurse or other designated school personnel to “assist” 
students who must “take” medication during the school day that has been prescribed for that student 
by his or her physician.  The terms “assist” and “administer” are not synonymous. An example of an 
unlicensed school employee “assisting” a student pursuant to EC Section 49423 would be when the 
school employee removes the cap from the medication bottle, pours out the prescribed dose into a 
cup or a spoon, and hands the cup or spoon to the student, who then “takes” or self-administers the 
required medication. With the above-stated statutory exceptions, there is no clear statutory authority 
in California permitting that same unlicensed school employee to “administer” any other medication. 
PROGRAM ADVISORY ON MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION10
CCR Title 5 601-611: California Department of Education “Program Advisory on Medication 
Administration” (2005, reviewed 2012). 
A	school	may	administer	medication	to	a	child	only	if	a	parent	or	guardian	has	specifically	requested	
such action and there is a reason to administer the medication when the child is at school.   
A	written	order	from	an	individual	who	is	licensed	to	prescribe	medications	must	be	on	file	in	order	to	
administer medications.  Medication may be administered at school by the school nurse, other duly 
qualified	supervisors	of	health,11  site administrator or designee as allowed by law. Neither the school 
nurse nor her designee is permitted to administer medication unless: 
1. The medication is in the original properly labeled container. If it is a prescription medicine,  
 the student’s name, name of the drug, dosage, time for administering, and name of health  
 care provider and current date is printed on the container. 
2.	 Written	orders	from	the	student’s	health	care	provider	are	on	file	in	the	school	stating:	
	 •	 Student’s	name	
	 •	 Date	of	Birth
	 •	 Name	of	medication	
	 •	 Dosage	(EC Section 49423)
	 •	 Purpose	of	the	medication

3.  Name, address, telephone number, and signature of the California authorized health care       
 provider.
4. The parent/guardian provides written permission to the school to administer a prescription  
 or over-the-counter medication. 
5. School personnel keep an individual record of any medications administered by school      
 personnel. 
6. Medication is stored in a clean, locked cabinet or container.
7. Written statements authorizing medications to be administered at school be renewed yearly  
 or whenever changes in medication or authorized health care provider occur.
8. Changes in medication authorization that generate a new written statement include the   
 following circumstances: 
 a. Changes in medication dose, time, and method of administration
 b. Change in medication
 c. Change in California authorized health care provider
 d. Discontinuance of medication administration
Additionally, school districts may want to consider requiring parents to sign a release from responsibility 
pertaining to side effects or other medical consequences that may be related to the medication(s).

INFECTION CONTROL
To reduce the spread of infectious diseases ( diseases that can be spread from one person to 
another), it is important to follow Universal Precautions  when providing care to any ill or injured 
student, whether or not the person is known to be infectious. Universal precautions are a set of 
guidelines	that	assume	that	all	blood	and	certain	other	body	fluids	are	potentially	infectious.		
The following list describes universal precautions:
 Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. When hands are   
	 	 visibly	dirty	or	visibly	soiled	with	blood	or	other	body	fluids	(be	sure	to	scrub	between	
	 	 fingers,	under	fingernails,	and	around	the	tops	and	palms	of	hands).	If	hands	are	not	
  visibly soiled you may use an alcohol-based hand rub.  
  Wash hands:
   1.    Before and after physical contact with any person 
                 ( even if gloves have been worn).
   2.    Before and after eating or handling food
   3.    After contact with a cleaning agent
   4.    After using the restroom
	 	 	 5.				 After	providing	any	first-aid
	 Wear	disposable	gloves	when	in	contact	with	blood	and	other	body	fluids.
	 Wear	protective	eyewear	when	body	fluids	may	come	in	contact	with	eyes	
  (e.g., squirting blood).
	 Wipe-up	any	blood	or	body	fluid	spills	as	soon	as	possible	( wear disposable gloves).  
  Double-bag the trash in plastic bags, or place in a Ziploc bag and dispose immediately.    
  Clean the area with an approved disinfectant or a bleach solution (one part liquid bleach 
  to 10 parts water).
	 Send all soiled clothing (i.e., clothing with blood, feces or vomit) home with the person in a
  double-bagged plastic bag.
	 Do	not	eat,	touch	your	mouth,	or	touch	your	eyes	while	giving	any	first	aid.
Guidelines:
•	 Remind	students	to	wash	hands	thoroughly	after	coming	in	contact	with	any	blood	or	body		
	 fluids.
•	 Remind	students	to	avoid	contact	with	another	person’s	blood	or	body	fluid.Emergency First Aid Guidelines for California Schools

CPR
NOTES ON PERFORMING CPR
The American Red Cross (ARC) guidelines follow the American Heart 
Association’s (AHA) new CPR guidelines for laypersons, “Guidelines 2010 for 
Emergency Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.”
BARRIER DEVICES
Barrier devices, to prevent the spread of infections from one person to another, can be 
used when performing rescue breathing. Several different types exist (e.g., face shields, 
pocket masks). It is important to practice using these devices in the presence of a trained 
CPR instructor before attempting to use them in an emergency situation.
AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs)
AEDs are devices that help to restore a normal heart rhythm when the heart is 
not beating properly. It does this by delivering an electric shock to the heart.
A physician’s prescription is required to purchase an AED. A physician is also required 
to provide medical direction to the school or school district that acquires an AED. If your 
school has an AED, obtain training in its use, and training in CPR, before an emergency 
occurs. The majority of AED use in the schools will be on adults at the facility, since the 
medical conditions likely to require use of an AED on a child are extremely rare.
AED training is offered through the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, 
the American Health and Safety Institute, the National Safety Council and other CPR and 
AED training programs. AED manufacturers also offer training. The AED regulations are 
available at the EMS Authority’s website http://www.emsa.ca.gov. See CA Code of 
Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 1.8, Training Standards and Utilization for 
Use	of	the	Automated	External	Defibrillator	by	Non-Licensed	and	Certified	Personnel

LAY PERSON CPR (CON’T)
FOR CHILDREN ONE YEAR OLD TO ADULT
CPR is to be used when a child or adult is unresponsive or when breathing or heart beat stops.
1.  Tap or gently shake the shoulder. Shout “Are you OK?” If that person is unresponsive,
 shout for help and send someone to call EMS 9-1-1.
2. Turn the person onto his/her back as a unit by supporting the head and neck. If head
 or neck injury is suspected, DO NOT BEND OR TURN NECK.
3.  Lift chin up and out with one hand while pushing down on the forehead with the other
 to open the AIRWAY. If head or neck injury suspected, hold head still and move jaw
 forward to open airway.
4.  Check for normal breathing by observation of chest, if there is no breathing or the patient is making gasping breaths
 then begin chest compressions at a rate of 100 per minute. Compress 30 times before beginning rescue breaths.
5.  If child is not breathing, seal your lips tightly around his/her mouth; pinch nose shut.
 While keeping the airway open, give 2 slow breaths (1 to 1½ seconds per breath) until chest rises.
IF AIR GOES IN:
(Chest rises with rescue breath)
6. Place heel of one hand on the lower half of
 breastbone. Do NOT place your hand over the very 
 bottom of the breastbone.

Note: Tetanus toxoid is nearly always combined with diphtheria 
and pertussis (DPT or TdaP).
A wound would need a tetanus booster if it has been at least 5 
- 10 years since the last tetanus shot or if the person is 5 years 
old or younger.
Other wounds, such as those contaminated by dirt, feces, saliva 
or	other	body	fluids;	puncture	wounds;	amputations;	and	wounds	
resulting from crushing, burns, and frostbite need a tetanus 
booster if it has been more than 5 years since the last tetanus
